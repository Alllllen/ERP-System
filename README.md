## About The Project
* Since the current records are all on paper, the only way to check the inventory is to estimate by experience, or to find paper data to calculate slowly, which lacks efficiency and accuracy, and cannot tell the customer how many finished goods can be shipped or how many raw materials have to be imported at the first time, so we use the system to solve the problem. 
* Since only the initial raw material and the final product are measured during the processing period, not all the processes are clearly measured, so if there is any consumption during the process, it may lead to inconsistency in the incoming and outgoing quantities. <Solution> We will suggest them to record the weight of all processes clearly, so that we can know the amount of loss caused by each process.
